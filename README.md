# Ready — Portfolio Webpage

This is a **responsive, cloud-themed portfolio website** that I edited using **Cursor AI**, deployed on **AWS EC2**, and managed via **GitHub**. The project demonstrates my hands-on experience with AI-assisted code edits, cloud deployment, and version control.

> ⚠️ Note: The website is currently **not live**. The EC2 instance was stopped to control costs, but all files and deployment instructions are included here.
